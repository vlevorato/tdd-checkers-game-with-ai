# tdd-checkers-game-with-ai

Show a simple example of how GenAI (LLM) can be a companion with TDD practice.

Here is the Claude 3.5 Sonnet start prompt:

*"I'd like to develop a game in Python: you're going to help me develop it using TDD, which allows the software architecture to emerge as we go along. 
The application must also respect the principles of Clean Architecture.
So I'm going to give you some features to do, one by one, and you're going to help me code them via TDD. Is that all right with you?"*
